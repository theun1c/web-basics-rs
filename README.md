# 🦖 About

I've recently started reading and learning a little about Rust, so I wanted to do some kind of project related to my current interests.

I came up with an idea for a small web app to track my reading. The idea is that I enter a line of text containing the work I've read, following a specific pattern.

Here's a small preview and my rough draft of the home page.

## TODO`s

- Edit project tree (reconsider the architecture)
- Implement the visual design of the main page based on the [layout](repo_assets/excalidraw/welcome-page.excalidraw) 
- Design a string parser (think through the main functionality of the site)
